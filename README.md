This project was put together by two Dans who grew up outside of Philadelphia.

1. Build the "slotted mic app", where people around the country, can sign up, pay 5 bucks or whatever,
   and the "list is the list".

1. Make merch part of site, where we try to sell shitty sweater with hole in it with the gopro sticking out.

1. When someone joins the Newsletter they get initial subscriber email. "Hey! Thanks for subscribing!"

1. Write article for Random page and put it there (thinking 'optimal trip article')

1. Potentially conditionally load fonts from google (on page load, not app load)

## Potential changes to NoCity.js page

1. Make it stylistically better and more engaging for the user
