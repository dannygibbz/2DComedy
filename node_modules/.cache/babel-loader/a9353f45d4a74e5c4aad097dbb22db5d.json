We had so\n              little time that we considered leaving the van running during the show.\n              Ahead of us lay the capstone of our driving marathon: Boise to Sioux Falls.\n              We had 36 hours to cover 1,250 miles. About a quarter of those miles are\n              scenic.

If a bug flies within five feet of the van, the\n              gravitational pull of the windshield makes escape impossible. Anything that\n              breaks that threshold is sucked in and immediately killed.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image11} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Bugs can’t really help it - they’re small and have little control over their\n              flightpath. Birds, however, <i>can</i> help it. They’re big and smart enough\n              to avoid vehicles -- yet they <i>tried</i> to hit the van. That’s why\n              we’re in no way joking when we say things are so grim in the ‘great’ plains\n              that even animals want to murder themselves.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We often joked that the creatures hitting our windshield were growing\n              progressively larger. It began with gnats, flies, and beetles. We figured\n              regular old birds were the logical conclusion but we were spectacularly\n              wrong. What happened next left us gobsmacked.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Bird is the word</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              On the unending plains, going 120 mph feels like going 30. Somewhere on the\n              Eastern end of Wyoming, we were zooming along … while still maintaining the\n              speed limit, of course. We’ve never broken a law in our lives.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image9} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Anyway, we were ‘doing the speed limit’ when out of nowhere a brown blur\n              exploded into our left periphery. The moment it appeared was the moment a\n              concussive blow echoed off the hood. It was deafening - like a cannonball\n              breaching the hull of a battleship. Before fully processing the noise, a\n              limp object rolled up the windshield and launched 20 feet into the air.\n              Stunned, I could only sputter out “What the FUCK was that?!”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              With “JESUS CHRIST’s! and other exclamations now ringing throughout the van,\n              Dan hung up a business call to join the ruckus. We were both hooting and\n              hollering, mystified by what just happened. In disbelief, Dan ventured “Was\n              that a piece of rubber?” The dusk had certainly obscured our vision, but it\n              was not rubber. There were no other vehicles on the road, no tires to blow.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              A hundred uncertainties flickered through my mind but one thing was certain\n              - whatever we hit was a <i>living thing</i> (WAS is the key word). With\n              adrenaline now coursing through my veins, everything slowed down and I\n              replayed what happened in my mind.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image2}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Shit, someone didn’t rewind”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The object that entered my vision was sleek -- full of purpose and control.\n              The object that exited my vision was a mangled bundle of ribbons. I realized\n              what it was. It was not rubber, or any inanimate object for that matter.
