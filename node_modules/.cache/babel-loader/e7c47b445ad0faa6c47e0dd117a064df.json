There are weeks when we hit a\n              new city every day, hitting the road as soon as shows ends. After{\" \"}\n              <Link to=\"/Gillette\">Gillette</Link>, we found ourselves without a pressing\n              deadline for the first time in a month. We didn’t have to be anywhere for 4\n              days and we didn’t know what to do with our newfound free time.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image7} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We kicked around some ideas with the Greenroom guys and decided to chill out\n              in an RV park for a couple of days. We chose a place outside Buffalo,\n              Wyoming that sat on the beautiful Lake De Smet.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image2} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              This place was out there. It definitely provided an unplugged, off the grid\n              feel. It was basically a camping trip - the only difference being our tent\n              (van) was made of aluminum. It was nice to unwind and put a hectic couple of\n              weeks behind us. We did all the traditional camping stuff: cooking over\n              fire, playing poker, and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“We should do this more often”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The park had no frills. We were ‘roughing it’ without wifi or showers. The\n              only thing they did have was electric hookups -- and we heard the constant\n              hum of voltage coursing through the power lines all day and night. We\n              decided to keep our distance from the electrocution waiting to happen.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Is this where we plug our stu….?”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">The friendly town</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After a few days of camping in the boonies, we were in desperate need of\n              bathing.

The first interesting fact was Casper should’ve been spelled\n              ‘Caspar’ to honor Fort Caspar and Lt. Caspar Collins, but someone botched it\n              when the town's name was officially registered.  Gotta love a town that\n              could easily fix an error but decides not to out of sheer laziness.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image3} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Plague upon sinners</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Some weird things were happening around town, and it all began on the drive\n              in. There were thousands and thousands of grasshoppers all over the place.\n              Everywhere we went the streets and buildings were crawling with them. We\n              decided to go inside and get away from the omnipresent vermin. It got\n              weirder from there.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We stood in line at Q’doba for maybe 30 seconds before the power blew out\n              with a loud “Whoom”. The whole place blacked out. We went across the street\n              to a Five Guys but it was the same deal - no power. Not about to give up the\n              search for food, we hopped in the van and began driving around to find\n              somewhere with running electricity.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“This is probably fine”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              As we drove through town we realized even the traffic lights were out. The\n              lack of traffic control left the streets in mass chaos and confusion. Horns\n              were honking, accidents nearly occurred every 50 feet, and random people\n              shambling through the streets. It looked like a scene out of The Walking\n              Dead.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It felt like the Plagues of Egypt. We were covered in boils (OK - mosquito\n              bites, but just go with it). Then came the swarms of grasshoppers. This was\n              followed by the blackout that left everyone in darkness. The only thing\n              missing was a firstborn massacre.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“Before the spear pierces your heart, just remember God loves you”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was at Gruner Brothers Brewing. The bar, restaurant, and\n              surrounding food trucks all did a great job of marketing the show - it\n              seemed like the whole city showed up. The online tickets sold out quickly,\n              as did the remaining tickets at the door. The place was packed.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image9} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Dan and I opened the show and did 12 minutes each, then Cody and James each\n              did 45. The crowd was amazing. In small towns where comedy isn’t readily\n              available, the audiences are always awesome. They’re excited to go out and\n              have fun - unlike, say, a comics mic in NYC.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image6} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image8} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The people always have a blast and tell us as much after the shows. They\n              always come up and say “thanks”  or talk about how much they laughed. It\n              feels good to serve laughs to underserved markets. It’s our version of a\n              soup kitchen.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When the show was finished we thanked Cody and James for having us on their\n              shows and went our separate ways.
