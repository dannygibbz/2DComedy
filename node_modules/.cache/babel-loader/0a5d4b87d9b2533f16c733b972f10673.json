className=\"copytext\">\n              Leaving <Link to=\"/Honolulu\">Hawaii</Link> was tough but we bounced back\n              pretty quickly upon returning to California. We drove to San Francisco and\n              stopped off in Palo Alto to see Dan’s old friends. The conversation covered\n              all the usual ‘catching up’ beats.

It\n              underscored another unwritten rule of comedy: The less interesting the topic\n              of conversation, the more people think it’ll end up in your act.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Everyone thinks their lives are far more interesting than they are.

Given that 95% of his\n              body is carpeted by hair, the first name they gave him was Hair-mione.

For example in the movie Swordfish, Hugh Jackman has 60 seconds\n              to hack into FBI servers with a chick blowing him and a gun to his head.\n              Think about that. Think about <i>how far overboard</i> the screenwriters had\n              to go to make programming interesting.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image17}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"Audience: “I still don’t give a fuck”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              And who casts these hacker movies? Who’s the guy that’s like “We need a\n              computer programmer … how about Wolverine?”. If these movies were even\n              remotely realistic, every computer hacker in every movie would be played by\n              Paul Giamatti.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“We’ve gotta hack into the mainframe!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Hollywood seriously doesn’t understand programming at all. There was another\n              movie called ‘Blackhat’ where Chris Hemsworth (Thor, the god of thunder)\n              plays a hacker. The FBI pulls him out of prison after 25 years to catch an\n              even more dangerous hacker. He’s had zero access to technology for two\n              decades -- <i>what does the FBI think he’s gonna do</i>? Hack everyone’s AOL\n              account?\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image12}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“Quick!

We expected a ‘no’ because of the timing but the host was awesome\n              and threw us on. He said he saw our website (this very one you’re reading!)\n              and thought “Ok, these guys are serious. I’ll put them on”.  It was\n              gratifying after so much time and effort that the website helped us get\n              work.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image2, image7]}\n              imageHeight={280}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The showcase was at a brewery - and those are always good rooms. All of the\n              features were great, so was the headliner. After the show we all went out to\n              grab some food and shoot the shit.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We had a good time in San Jose. One benefit of constant travel is never\n              staying anywhere long enough to develop a negative impression. Every scene\n              has drama in some shape or form, but as outsiders we have no dog in the\n              fight. We come, meet people, do shows, and move on. It’s awesome.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The only disadvantage of constant travel is not being able to stay long\n              enough to do more shows. We’re always grateful for stage time but\n              occasionally our schedule is too tight to stay longer in town. We love\n              meeting comics and building relationships, so it sucks to have so many\n              goodbyes. The good news is we usually see each other again in one city or\n              another.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              From San Jose we worked our way North to{\" \"}\n              <Link to=\"/PortlandOr\">Portland, Oregon</Link>.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
