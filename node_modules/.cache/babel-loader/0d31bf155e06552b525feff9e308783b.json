Both operate in the performing arts, both perform in front of\n              live audiences, both spend a lot of time practicing the craft, both work\n              hard to get stage time, and both are starving.

A\n              friend recommended floating in a sensory deprivation tank -- they thought\n              after spending so much time on the road, it’d be nice for us to have some\n              quiet and solitude. Something where we could sit and collect our thoughts -\n              maybe even think of new bits. We decided to try it out.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The worker at the place told us it takes a while to learn how to float\n              properly -- but there’s nothing to learn. You just sit there. It’s like\n              being told you have to learn how to recline.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I think I’m getting the hang of it!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When he was giving us the intro, he mentioned that they fill these tanks\n              with “10,000 lbs” of salt. With the price of salt what it is, there is\n              absolutely no way that they throw the salt away between uses. The only thing\n              I could think when I entered was how recently this salt water was used. To\n              add to that paranoia, I reached my hands out during my float, and felt the\n              previous occupant’s earplugs. I could feel the ghosts of everyone who had\n              ever entered this crypt.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Alone at last”\"}\n            />\n\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Good eats</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We tried a Cincinnati staple called Skyline Chili. If you haven’t heard of\n              it, imagine chili slopped on ramen buried under a mountain of shredded\n              cheese. It’s a culinary concoction only a stoned college student could\n              devise. It’s the meal you demolish after 14 shots of Fireball at an after\n              hours bar. Incidentally, nearly everyone at the restaurant was stoned or\n              drunk.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image8}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  Do you want ramen, chili, or nachos?       <b>“Yes”</b>\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Every city has at least one staggeringly unhealthy dish that they take pride\n              in, even if it seems gross to outsiders.

He told everyone that they should put us on shows - it was\n              above and beyond nice!\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We did a show at Mac’s pizza pub, which is technically Kentucky but we’re\n              considering it Cincinnati because all the cincy comics said it was. Everyone\n              much more lax about city boundaries in Cincinnati than in Philly. If you\n              cross the bridge into Covington or Newport (both KY) they consider it\n              Cincinnati. If you cross the bridge from Philly to Camden, you are in a land\n              unto itself. No one would ever consider it a part of Philly.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image9, image12]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was awesome. We talked to a bunch of comedians before the show who\n              knew we were coming in, and they couldn’t have been friendlier. The host\n              even gave us some extra stage time to work stuff out. The overall experience\n              was awesome, and the comedians were hilarious.
