Anywhere else, the term\n              ‘lot lizard’ refers to prostitutes that frequent truck stops, but in\n              Albuquerque it was in reference to scaly, scabby meth-heads who steal from\n              cars.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Our van looks like a standard cargo/work vehicle, so we weren’t concerned\n              about potential thievery … until a local told us about someone calling 9/11\n              just to steal the ambulance. The thief needed a vehicle to drive around and\n              score heroin.

The types who would play\n              extremely convincing extras as either “junkie” or “zombie”. Due to Breaking\n              Bad, the reputation for ‘drug of choice’ in ABQ is meth.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Meth is a strange beast. It’s really the only drug where people crack up at\n              the havoc it wreaks. There are countless videos out there with titles like\n              “The Faces of Meth” where timelapse photos show users becoming hideously\n              disfigured after long-term use. There’s usually even a studio audience\n              laughing along, practically rolling in the aisles.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image9, image5]}\n              imageHeight={250}\n              captionText={\n                \"“Woah-hoah-hoah!

People have no qualms snickering at lives destroyed by meth, yet\n              somehow it would be in poor taste if slideshows covered lives destroyed by\n              pills. Also, addiction is a disease -- you wouldn’t see a “Faces of Cancer”\n              video with a laugh track. But meth?

The trick to\n              counteract too much sitting … is <i>walking</i>. We didn’t expect much from\n              a clickbait article, but Jesus. That was really scraping the bottom of the\n              barrel. It must have been part of a health tip series, preceded by “Not\n              getting enough nutrients?

It was\n              cool to see such a tight group - camaraderie like that doesn’t exist\n              everywhere.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image1, image10]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              That night we stayed in a hotel and ordered some pizza. Dan was on the phone\n              with the pizza place and they needed the address spelled out. We were on\n              Turner street and Dan began “It’s Turner street.
