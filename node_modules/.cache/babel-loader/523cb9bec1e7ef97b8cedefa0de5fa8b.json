We knocked out the three hour\n              drive and pulled into town around 1 in the morning. Huntington is an\n              interesting spot. It’s mashed into a corner of the map where West Virginia,\n              Ohio, and Kentucky come together.  If you go right instead of left or North\n              instead of South, you can find yourself in an entirely new state.

The whole conversation was alarmingly casual given the grave\n              nature of <i>murder</i>. After hearing of the arrest, one of the guys\n              commented incredulously “I heard the dude aint even die tho!” as if that\n              would exonerate his buddy for the shooting.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image14}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“You’re fine.

It wasn’t unplugged, there were just NO WIRES\n              attached to the phone or the wall.
