That was enough for us -- we drove\n              East to check it out. Dan C loves Pittsburgh - he has family there, went to\n              college there, and said it’s a great comedy town. I had never been and had\n              only heard negative things. Friends and family affectionately called it\n              “Shittsburgh” and made it sound like a wasteland of toothless, jersey-clad\n              Steelers fans belligerently shouting “Six rings! Six rings!!”. I was eager\n              to see for myself.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Philly to Pittsburgh is roughly a five hour drive - no big deal. As we were\n              packing the van we realized the heat suddenly stopped working - big deal.\n              Driving five hours through the frost covered tundra didn’t sound too\n              appealing, and breaking down in central PA would be a nightmare - there’s\n              nothing out there. I figured we were probably low on antifreeze and popped\n              the hood to check.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I couldn’t see <i>any</i>&nbsp; liquid in the reservoir. Thinking the\n              plastic was too thick to see through, I decided to unscrew the cap and have\n              a look inside. After a few turns, I felt significant pressure buildup.\n              Instead of thinking “Maybe I oughta wait a bit to unscrew this” I thought\n              “fuck this thing, I’m not going to let it beat me” and cranked with all my\n              might. The cap blasted off like a rocket, unleashing a volcanic eruption of\n              antifreeze that left me soaked. I’m glad I wasn’t looking straight down the\n              pipe.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Yep - just a tad low”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Covered in steaming purple fluid, I was able to conclude that not a\n              milliliter of antifreeze remained in the vehicle. Every last drop was in my\n              clothes and hair. We quickly refilled the reservoir and the van heated right\n              up, thankfully. If I had to endure the whole ride drenched in coolant and\n              various oils without heat, I would have had frostbite by Harrisburg, and who\n              knows what by Pittsburgh.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Can you crack a window?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We found it strange that the antifreeze had been that low in the first\n              place. After topping off in Philly we checked the coolant every hour or so\n              to see if there was a leak. Sure enough, by the time we reached Steel City\n              it was almost empty again. We took the van to a garage that said they’d have\n              her out quick. That ‘quick fix’ ended up taking three days and a couple\n              hundred dollars.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Life on the road is austere. There are no warm beds, hot meals, or creature\n              comforts. You’re out in the wild, untethered ... until your vehicle (or\n              home) is in the shop. Believe it or not, business owners aren’t crazy about\n              having drifters sleep in vehicles under their roof. I don’t understand where\n              it comes from. When have people in vans ever done anything to anyone?\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image7, image2, image6]}\n              imageHeight={180}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When traveling, we live a no frills existence. We work remotely in cafe’s,\n              shower at Planet Fitness, and spend evenings at comedy clubs or bars before\n              passing out in the van. Our diets are trash. We subsist primarily on duck\n              food - crackers, bread, and the occasional sandwich. Sometimes we eat fast\n              food, but we really only borrow it.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I really gotta take a … piss”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              That spartan lifestyle ended as soon as the van entered the shop. We went\n              straight to Dans grandparents house and lived like little princes for three\n              days. We had home-cooked meals and warm beds for the first time in ages. The\n              only thing missing was footie pajamas with butt flaps - which i’m sure his\n              grandma would’ve knitted immediately if we had asked.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Staying with grandparents is the only thing that can change a person's\n              behavior so quickly. When fresh baked cookies hit the table, you instantly\n              transform from a 28 year old telling autoerotic asphyxiation jokes to an 8\n              year old telling corny knock-knock jokes. Grandparents just have that\n              calming influence. It was relaxing to get off the road for a few days and\n              focus on writing.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We reverted back to our old selves as soon as the van was fixed. When it got\n              out of the shop we went straight to a mic. The first show we did was at a\n              college. We jumped at the chance to perform somewhere other than a bar or\n              club. College was a really unique experience for us. We looked and felt old\n              as shit. When we walked around campus we felt like wizened old trolls\n              prowling a playground.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image8}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“What time does orientation start?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Most of the performers on this show were new to comedy, and the audience\n              could feel their nervous energy. Confidence on stage is a strange beast.\n              Awkward nervousness works if it’s part of the act, but genuine nervousness\n              is the kiss of death. Although audiences generally root for performers, they\n              will turn their back if they sense weakness. Great jokes can get crickets if\n              delivered nervously, and bad jokes can get belly laughs if delivered\n              confidently. It’s like a jedi mind trick.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“You will laugh at these jokes. I’m not actively shitting myself”\"\n              }\n            />\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Dan and I have already died a thousand deaths on stage, so we were\n              untouchable. We were like the grizzled sergeant calmly strolling around a\n              battlefield with a cig in his mouth as bullets whiz past his head. There was\n              a collective breath of relief when the crowd realized it wasn’t our first\n              rodeo. We closed the show and crushed the room - it was a great feeling.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We were immediately encircled by students when the show ended. They were\n              starry-eyed and excited to talk to us. It felt like a bit like being famous,\n              which was hilarious for us. We are anonymous open mic comedians. Most crowds\n              view us like pond scum, but this crowd viewed us like national headliners.\n              Like two big time gunslingers dropping in and and tearing shit up.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Of course our little moment was extremely short lived. An hour later we hit\n              a bar mic and were immediately knocked back down to Earth. No asses were\n              kissed and no shits were given. We went from killing the crowd to the crowd\n              wanting to kill us for interrupting the Penguins game.
