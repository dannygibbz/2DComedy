Staff from the Colombian\n              team routinely visited the U.S. for meetings and we built a good rapport.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“The efficacy has been clinically proven, we’re just waiting on DEA… er, FDA approval”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The idea for this trip was hatched when one of the guys from the Medellin\n              office was visiting the states. His name was -- you’ll never guess -- Dan.\n              We’re all Dan’s here. Even you can be a Dan if you try hard enough.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We were at Dave and Busters for team building when Dan (Danny from here on\n              out to avoid confusion) and I decided to grab some drinks. It was a chill\n              Saturday and we were off the clock. We bought a huge beer tower thinking\n              everyone would want some, but we thought wrong. Everyone was being fucking\n              boring, so Danny and I were stuck with a huge vat of beer to ourselves.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“It’s technically one drink.

We’re outside\n              of work but we should probably maintain a modicum of professional behavior”,\n              but as soon as Danny and I locked eyes, that thought was replaced by “Fuck\n              these pussies. If they don’t want to drink, good. More for us. Buncha\n              goddamn Sober Sallies”. With a clink of glasses our friendship was born.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Origins</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Sometimes the best friendships are born of conspiratorial or mischievous\n              beginnings. This instance with Danny was one in a line of similar\n              friendships for me. The first happened in late 2012. I had just finished\n              college and moved to China for work. My new coworkers came from all over the\n              globe and had the varied personalities and accents to prove it.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              One day early on, I entered the staff lounge to find a large contingent of\n              the new group embroiled in a debate about cultural appropriation. Who better\n              to weigh in on such an issue than me?\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image15}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"The very portrait of racial and cultural diversity\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">What do you think?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I missed 95% of the discussion but found out a sorority in the U.S. was in\n              hot water over a Mexican-themed party where people wore ponchos, sombreros,\n              and fake moustaches. A former sorority girl from Texas, and thus closer to\n              the whole debacle, asked me to weigh in.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image2} imageWidth={500} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I could have (should have) politely remarked something equivocal like “If\n              something could potentially offend someone, it’s best to err on the side of\n              caution and not do it”. But I had a whole year with these people ahead of\n              me. We still were all getting to know one another, and I didn’t want people\n              to like me under the false pretense of being nice.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I wanted to find out who did and didn’t have a sense of humor. When I was\n              hit with “What do you think?” I replied “That sounds like Juan hell of a\n              party” and instantly divided the room -- hard. Most sat goggle-eyed in\n              stunned silence, appalled that I could be such a cretin. But a small group\n              laughed out loud and I knew I just made some tight friends.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Dividing the room</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              A similar watershed moment happened again two years later in Tokyo, Japan.\n              It was day one of a two-week training program for my new job. I was teaching\n              English to business professionals and the company had a reputation as an\n              industry leader for their use of technology and sophisticated instructional\n              aids.

The illustrations were meant\n              to help students use target language from the lesson. For example, if the\n              lesson was about giving directions, the illustration book had a\n              corresponding street map drawing so the student could ask where things were.\n              Sounds great - only the illustrations were fucking horrific. They looked\n              like the scribblings of a lobotomized four year old with parkinson's. Every\n              illustration looked like photocopy of a polaroid of hieroglyph.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Using todays vocab, explain what’s happening here”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              At the end our first day of training, everyone was in the elevator talking\n              about how impressed they were with the training and the company in general.\n              They were still in that artificial “I’m a go-getter, a real company man!”\n              mindset that comes with being new at a job and fizzles out after a week.\n              Listening to all this shit, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes internally\n              (probably externally, too).\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When the nauseating wave of positivity found my corner of the elevator,\n              someone said “this company is great, don’t you think?” and I said “Yeah, you\n              can clearly tell they’re committed to excellence. I mean just look at that\n              illustration book -- clearly they spared no expense commissioning the very\n              best artists”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Most clammed up immediately, shocked that I had the gall to talk shit on day\n              one.

After taking down the beer tower, I knew he was cool.\n              After taking down a second tower, we were already planning a trip to\n              Colombia. It took two years for everything to line up and actually go, but\n              we were going, goddammit.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Strangers in a strange land</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              This was Dan C’s first time leaving the country and he was especially\n              excited to be an exotic bird in a faraway land. He imagined being an\n              American force of nature; a sexual magnet that women couldn’t keep their\n              hands off of.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It didn't shake out that way. When we stepped out of the taxi and onto the\n              crowded street, I lost him immediately. I’ve never seen anyone blend into a\n              crowd that quickly. He was like a hairy chameleon.

The first unfortunate resemblance was to a famous mathematician\n              named Baldor. Apparently this dude wrote the standard algebra textbook used\n              by everyone in South America - which meant whenever ANY women looked at Dan,\n              they had immediate, instinctive dislike. There’s no quicker method of\n              unsexification than looking at someone and immediately recalling your dry,\n              wrinkly old math teacher in the sack.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image9}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I wanna lie tangent to your curves… Where ya going?!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We figured a worse lookalike couldn’t exist, and we were wrong. Danny\n              informed us that having a big beard in Colombia is associated with left-wing\n              extremism. As soon as Danny said this, his friend who barely spoke English\n              and had been quiet all day shouted “Ohhh ja, he look like Hipster Fidel\n              Castro!” Danny’s girlfriend laughed so hard I worried we might have to call\n              for an ambulance.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image13, image12, image4]}\n              imageHeight={240}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I, on the other hand, drew every eyeball everywhere we went. I was an utter\n              spectacle to behold. I was easily the palest person in the country and no\n              one had ever seen such a fiery red beard. People walking and talking with\n              their friends literally stopped dead in their tracks and stared when I\n              walked by. At one point we passed a street food vendor making pancakes and\n              when his eyes fell upon me, he froze like a statue and I swear to God even\n              the pancake stopped flipping and hung mid-air.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">¿How did you find it?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We searched Google and Facebook for shows but weren’t having any luck --\n              English comedy nights were few and far between.

Rest is a\n              relative term. Our hostel was under construction, so basically it was\n              perfect if you hate sleeping. Beginning at 7 a.m. every day - even on\n              Saturday - a symphony of belt sanders, table saws, and bench grinders roared\n              to life - ensuring we didn’t waste ANY time in bed.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Heavy bamboo stalks were dropped at random each morning, sending thunderous\n              reverberations throughout the entire hostel. Nail guns filled brief\n              interludes with a staccato “pop!-pop!-pop!” and screaming workers rounded\n              out the chorus. Right when we thought it possible to steal a single wink,\n              the cement-footed foreman clomped around on the tin roof dropping paint cans\n              and bocce balls.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image7}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Alright boys, on 3”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We flew home bleary eyed and delirious but once we saw the van, a sense of\n              calm washed over us.

Words like ‘putrid’ and ‘vomit-inducing’ fail to convey\n              just how foul this odor was. After ten sleepless nights in Colombia and a\n              long day traveling back, the last thing we wanted to do was tear the van\n              apart.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We tried to lie to ourselves like “I don’t smell anything weird.

We tossed\n              our bags in the back of the van and decided to drive somewhere for food. We\n              drove with the windows down to get some fresh air but the odor was like\n              fire; oxygen made it stronger.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After driving around for 30 minutes it was clear not only did the smell\n              exist, but it was here to stay. Both of us were still unwilling to bring it\n              up - it was like playing a game of chicken. Neither wanted to be the one to\n              make it real.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Breaking point</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I could take no more.

Every step\n              unleashed a toxic cloud of rancid meat essence.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We don’t have a refrigerator in the van -- we use(d) a cooler and ice to\n              keep food cold. We forgot to empty it before our trip - leaving lunchmeat\n              and milk to rot away. During our absence, every bit of ice melted and blew\n              the lid off. The noxious fluid soaked into the rug, and the powerful Miami\n              sun baked it in good and deep.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Drying the rug was out of the question. Even we got it bone-dry, the odor\n              was too deeply ingrained in the carpet fibers to ever come out. Our only\n              course of action was to treat it like cancer and cut out the malignance.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">A rare honor</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Walmart is known for having crazy clientele. People screaming, fighting, and\n              walking around half naked are daily occurrences. To win the Craziest\n              Customer Contest is no easy feat but on that night, we took it home.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We looked insane. Here were two sleep deprived guys with feral hair,\n              bloodshot eyes, and exacto blades violently cutting strips of rug out of a\n              van. It didn't help that from within the van wafted the odor of a\n              decomposing walrus carcass. People probably thought were cutting out a\n              carpet coffin to dispose of a corpse we just Eiffel Towered.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Our next stop was <Link to={\"/NewOrleans\"}>New Orleans</Link>.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
