But the moment we were\n              on main street Omaha, we saw Jesse Eisenberg. He was walking down the street\n              with his little daughter. We hope he was there for a shoot - if he was just\n              on vacation in Nebraska, we’d have to seriously question his sanity.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Hey, I just like the Midwest, OK?!”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Carbs are killers</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We tried Omaha steaks and they were delicious. We told a local about it and\n              he said “I know it tastes good but it’s loaded with saturated fats”. We\n              should mention this guy recently dropped a few lbs, and there’s nothing\n              worse than people that just lost weight. They constantly brag about losing\n              40 pounds, yet if they hadn’t said anything everyone would’ve assumed they\n              just gained 80.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Even worse, they suddenly become exercise and nutrition experts.

They’re always saying things like “The secret is just keep\n              walkin’!”. You never see a person who beat depression march up to a group of\n              happy people saying “The secret is just keep smilin’!”.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I’m so happy it HURTS”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Chicanery</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There’s all kinds of bullshit out there for weight loss and happiness. We\n              saw an article recently that stated “one simple trick could boost confidence\n              and reduce stress''. The magical trick? Holding a Superman for two minutes a\n              day.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={300}\n              captionText={\"“Great, now I can live in this hell forever”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              A compelling argument. Let’s see. On the one hand we have billions of\n              dollars going into neuropharmacology research each year to study\n              brain-chemical interaction and understand behavioral effects in the hope of\n              improving mental health and quality of life.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              And on the other hand, we have “Nah, fuck all that shit. Just stand like\n              Superman!”. I wonder which has higher levels of efficacy. That’d be like\n              tossing a paralyzed person in the ocean and saying “Don’t worry, just stand\n              like Aquaman!”\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“It’s working!”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">The Zoo</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Omaha has a zoo that everyone was very proud of. We checked it out and it\n              was nice - but the best part of any public place is people watching and\n              listening. We were standing outside the aquarium as a couple was discussing\n              how smart all the fish were. I’m sorry, what?\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image7}\n              imageWidth={300}\n              captionText={\"“Heheheh I went poopy!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Animals aren’t smart. They’re just not, at least in relation to humans. It’s\n              not even close. Let’s take the dolphin for example. Dolphins are supposedly\n              the most intelligent creature in existence. Why? “Because they can\n              communicate with other dolphins and have sex for pleasure”. That’s the bar?\n              That literally describes every dude on planet Earth.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image8}\n              imageWidth={300}\n              captionText={\"Check out the mating call of this genius\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We seriously don’t understand why people think dolphins are so great. They\n              act like dolphins can cure cancer or go to the moon. If dolphins ever build\n              sophisticated underwater civilizations, I’ll be impressed. If they reverse\n              engineer SCUBA, come to land, study humans, and open up “Landworld” with\n              human exhibits under the sea, I’ll be impressed. Until then, I’ll wait for\n              these dipshits to figure out how not to choke themselves on plastic.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“Wow, what’s that?

The next\n              comic was a woman who hilariously described the weird shit she encounters in\n              the hood. Dan and I went after her, and then it was the closer. The closer\n              was a comic out of New York who’d been on Conan, Last Comic Standing, and a\n              bunch of other shows. He talked about how underwhelming the Omaha zoo was.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image2, image6]}\n              imageHeight={145}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After Omaha we began the long haul to{\" \"}\n              <Link to=\"/Gillette\">Gillette, Wyoming</Link>.
