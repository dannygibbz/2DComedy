It’s like high school! You don’t know shit!”\n              and you could be right. We were only there for a few days so naturally we\n              had on rose-tinted glasses.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Slotted mics</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              LA was the first city in which we experienced ‘slotted’ mics. For those\n              unfamiliar with the concept, it’s simple: you check the schedule on the\n              clubs website and pick a date/time you want to perform. Shows are an hour\n              long. There are 9 slots at 5 minutes a pop. On the night of the show you\n              venmo the club $5 dollars and you’re set. We found slotted mics to be\n              awesome, but some people aren’t fans. We’ll break down the pros and cons\n              below.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">The argument for</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <ul>\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  The timing is perfect - an hour is the sweet spot.\n                </li>\n\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  You can actually plan out your night as you know exactly when shows\n                  begin and end. No wondering “when the hell will I get up, at midnight?”.\n                  It’s perfect if you’re trying to schedule multiple mics a night.{\" \"}\n                </li>\n\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  There’s no bumrush for a list. Signups are done well ahead of time.\n                </li>\n\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  You do not get bumped. No last minute “Oh hey, my buddy just walked in,\n                  I’ll get you up later” or “we’re not following the list”. You get the\n                  exact slot that you signed up for.{\" \"}\n                </li>\n\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  Comics must arrive on time and stay for the duration. This guarantees\n                  you’re not hurling jokes down a black hole to no one.{\" \"}\n                </li>\n\n                <li style={{ marginBottom: \"15px\" }}>\n                  A tight atmosphere is cultivated, if only for 60 minutes. You’re knit\n                  into a little group and are more likely to connect after the show. When\n                  shows have 20 + comics coming and going, it’s hard to make any\n                  connections.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  Because everyone takes time to book their slot in advance and shell out\n                  some dough, they are generally more serious about preparing actual\n                  material and improving. It weeds out lazy comics who pace around stage\n                  trying to think of ‘funny stuff’ that happened this week or tell\n                  meandering stories without jokes.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <b>Closing argument:</b> It’s how every mic should be run.

There were so many points for slotted and\n              almost none against” You’re right. We are biased - if you don’t like it,\n              feel free to leave some hate in the comments. Oh, you can’t find the\n              comments? That’s because it’s our website, not yours.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Suck it, nerds”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              For the complaints about paying, all we can say is “Boo hoo”. If you’re\n              serious about getting better at anything, investment is required. Be it\n              time, money, resources, or a combination of the three, you need to invest to\n              improve. End of story.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If you’re still saying “Well, you shouldn’t have to pay!”, then you’re not\n              considering ‘paying’ in the form of time. If you go to a regular mic where\n              30 people sign up and don’t follow an order, you’ve just spent 2-3 hours\n              waiting, minimum. That’s 2-3 hours you could’ve spent writing, hitting the\n              gym, sleeping, or doing whatever it is you enjoy doing.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image3} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Also, let’s face it, 5 bucks is not make or break. $5 dollars an hour is\n              less than minimum wage. Not being arrogant, but we think our time is worth\n              more than that. Sorry, not sorry. We’d much rather spend money to save time\n              than spend time to save money.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <b>*Disclaimer* We are not for ALL paid mics.</b> Some cities have pay mics\n              that are not slotted. You pay just to be on a show and also have a one drink\n              minimum. Avoid these if you can. If it’s not slotted, you’re wasting time\n              which obviously defeats the purpose.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The first show we did was at a spot in Koreatown called Fourth Wall. It was\n              a slotted mic we booked a few days ahead of time and it was great. I\n              addition to the 8 or 9 comics, there were also regular audience members\n              watching and enjoying. It was an intimate space full of funny, talented\n              people working out bits.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image7, image5]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After the show we talked to some of the comics and exchanged positive\n              feedback. It’s much easier to connect when people haven’t been leaving at\n              random intervals throughout a show. Overall we were really impressed with\n              the quality of comedians.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We did another mic the following day and it was the same story, different\n              sets. We have nothing but positive things to say about the comics, the shows\n              structure, and the positive culture it creates\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image4, image8]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We really enjoyed LA.
