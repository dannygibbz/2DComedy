our second-to-last state. Being right across the bridge from\n              Philly, everyone always responded with “What?! You’re just doing Jersey\n              now?!”. Yep. You know the old saying “Saving the best for last”? We wanted\n              to do the opposite.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"Suck it, Jersey\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              In honesty, it wasn’t out of some bullshit state rivalry that we waited\n              until the end for Jersey. State rivalries are ridiculous. Here’s how these\n              things work. If it’s a North-South situation, the rivalry is about\n              intelligence. The farther North the state, the smarter the people think they\n              are. If it’s an East-West situation, the rivalry is about sports. Both think\n              the other one sucks more (and both are dumb).\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image11} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The truth is, we began the trip in January because we just wanted to get the\n              fuck out of the cold. It was easy to skip Jersey because we knew it wasn’t\n              (and isn’t) going anywhere, no matter how much everyone wishes it would.\n              From Philly it was a pedal to the metal scream down the coast until we\n              reached Florida.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Mistaken Identity</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              For most of our tour Dan rocked a beard that screamed “Allahu Akbar”.

We don’t even almost look alike. I look like a 13th century\n              Scotsman and Dan looks like a 15th century Sikh. We resemble one another\n              about as much as Shaq and Peter Dinklage.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image12}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Dude, you killed it as Tyrion Lannister”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              But once we returned from Connecticut, it happened. Dan shaved his beard for\n              the first time in a year and suddenly we were one and the same. Despite\n              differences in skin tone, facial features, height, weight, and ancestry, we\n              learned that facial hair is the only thing preventing us from identical\n              status.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image14}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“2DComedy set to star in the remake of Mary-Kate and Ashley’s ‘It Takes Two’”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We arrived at the bar before the show started and ordered some drinks. Dan\n              ordered a Sprite and walked away to find a table. I then ordered a beer and\n              waited at the bar. When the glass was full the bartender turned around,\n              looked right through me, and then walked across the room to give Dan his\n              (my) beer and his (my) debit card.

They told us about the scenes in New\n              Brunswick, Jersey City, Hoboken, and Asbury Park. Although the opinions on\n              each city in Jersey varied, one common theme was almost everyone hated the\n              New York scene.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              That topic is too long to cover in this article but if you’re interested in\n              hearing about what that’s like, check out this{\" \"}\n              <Link to=\"/NewYork\">article</Link>.

He had recently made the move to Jersey City and was still getting\n              his feet wet. We talked about all the old haunts in Philly that none of us\n              missed and it was a nice little chat.  He joked about shit he’d do as a host\n              in Philly (throw the list out, switch up the order, etc.) that drove us\n              insane.
