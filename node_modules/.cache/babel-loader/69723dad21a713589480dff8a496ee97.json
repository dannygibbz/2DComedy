ride from <Link to=\"/Nashville\">Nashville</Link> to Memphis is just over\n              three hours of long, empty highways dotted with Bible thumpin’ billboards.\n              Every ten miles or so a new ad would appear with large text spouting\n              nonsense like “In the beginning, GOD created...” accompanied by an image of\n              evolution with a huge red{\" \"}\n

notice anything, let\n              alone banal billboards. About 3/4ths of the way through the trip, Dan had\n              long been daydreaming in the passenger seat and I was only just more\n              cognizant of my surroundings than he. We were expecting to complete the\n              journey on autopilot when suddenly the most peculiar billboard we’ve ever\n              seen jarred us out of our reveries.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We were cruisin’ down the highway at a good clip when from the corner of my\n              eye I spied what looked like an igloo built atop a billboard poking through\n              a clutch of trees. I only managed to spit out “...Wha?” which snapped Dan\n              awake. He quickly looked over and howled “What? WHAT?! Dude turn around.\n              Turn AROUND! We gotta go back!”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There’s no easy way to ‘go back’ on a major highway. You’re stuck until the\n              nearest exit appears. Then you reenter in the opposite direction and drive\n              until you can reverse again. We knew turning around would be at least a 20\n              minute detour but we <i>had to</i> do it. We needed to make sure we weren’t\n              imagining things.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We were laughing the whole way back and keeping our eyes peeled for the\n              nearest exit. After a few miles we saw the billboard from behind and\n              confirmed it did indeed look as if an igloo or hill of some sort was built\n              into the rear wood paneling.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When we finally faced it head-on, we had to pull over to really soak in what\n              stood before us.

We just don’t understand what\n              goes through peoples heads.

By all means carry on your workout.

The\n              tables and chairs were mixed in with couches, giving the space a homey air.\n              The bar owners dog was also roaming around, providing a familial atmosphere.\n              The dog was really sweet - it walked around and nuzzled up to just about\n              everyone before settling down on a couch with Dan and I.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After a few minutes the host, a black female, walked in the side door and\n              the dog went ballistic. It tore away from the couch and made beeline for\n              her. The dog was only barking because someone new had entered - but from the\n              hosts perspective it looked like we shouted “Sic ‘er!”\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Thankfully she made a joke about it.

On this particular night, we saw a guy go on <i>after</i> the\n              show ended. Apparently he forgot to write his name down, so as the host\n              announced the end of the show, he yelled from the back “I still have to\n              go!”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              This ensuing scene was not good. Everyone was shuffling around, confused,\n              and kind of bummed to have to be quiet again all of a sudden. The guy got up\n              and forgot most of his set. Half of the audience wasn’t paying attention as\n              he stammered through the remainder, but commanding a room after the show had\n              already “ended” is no small feat.
