beautiful ride from <Link to=\"/Austin\">Austin</Link> to Tucson.\n              Throughout the 13-hour drive, the landscape continually transformed. What\n              began with green trees became red rock and finally desert. The\n              transformation even extended to our van. Every winged insect in the\n              Southwest kamikaze’d us, transforming our windshield from a protective plate\n              of glass into an abstract impressionist canvas.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If we had still been in still Austin, corduroy-clad hipsters would’ve\n              considered it a masterpiece of modern art.

Texas and\n              Arizona were neck-and-neck. The first signs that struck us were construction\n              zone signs warning not to hit the workers. Not because you’d end a human\n              life, but because it would cost you $10,000 dollars.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image2}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“AND i’ll lose my license?

The next sign that caught our\n              attention cautioned motorists not to pick up hitchhikers, as they could be\n              escaped prisoners. Thanks for the warning - we’d never have been able to\n              identify prisoners without it.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image8}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“That shackled man in the orange jumpsuit sure looks like he could use a ride”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Here’s a crazy thought: maybe they could just <i>not let inmates escape</i>.\n              How lazy do the guards have to be? It’s not like there's anywhere for\n              prisoners to hide. There’s only one road and it stretches into eternity. In\n              any direction, you’ve got 100 miles of visibility. They must spot escapees\n              from the watchtower and sigh “Well, we put signs up”.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“He’s over there, now.

Our van is the least aerodynamic vehicle in\n              existence and tall vehicles get blown over all the time.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“License and registration”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The sign was memorable due to its theoretical nature. It didn’t say\n              “Caution: High Wind Zone” or “Warning: Severe Wind Gusts”. It read “High\n              Winds May Exist”. We liked that the sign maker treated the existence of wind\n              with the conviction of an agnostic. It’s nice that their philosophy degree\n              was finally put to use.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“If wind blows a tree and no one is around to see it, does it even rustle?”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Hot hot heat</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Weather wise, we got to Arizona just in time -- right before the summer heat\n              &nbsp;<i>really</i> kicked in. You probably know Arizona is hot, but what\n              you may not know is it’s a <b>‘dry heat’</b>. We know this, because it’s the{\" \"}\n              <i>only</i> thing people in Arizona talk about. You could meet someone and\n              ask “What are some good hikes out here?” and they’d reply “Haha yeah, it\n              really is a dry heat”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              At our first show, I decided to open my set with “Do you guys like dry heat\n              out here?” and the audience exploded. They loved it. I followed up with\n              “That was a joke, I know you love it - it’s all you fuckin’ talk about” and\n              the room deflated. They were <i>hurt</i>. It was like they opened up about a\n              deep, dark secret and I spat in their face. In the end I won them back, but\n              only with concentrated effort.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The next night I was planning to fuck with the crowd by saying “Man, it’s\n              humid as hell out here!”, but after witnessing the anguish caused by the\n              last joke, I feared the audience might have a seizure.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“NOOOOO!!!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was a lot of fun. It was a two parter - the first half was regular\n              old comedy, the second half cat-themed comedy (once a month they hold shows\n              that have a specific comedic theme, and this time it happened to be cats).\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We saw another cool thing at the show that was a testament to the\n              therapeutic value of comedy. One of the comedians had been involved in a\n              terrible a car accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury. It impaired\n              his speech and made it difficult to get around. Despite the challenges, he\n              got on stage, talked about it, and was hilarious. He made light of the\n              situation and found a positive way to deal with it. It was inspiring to see\n              this guy making the best of a bad situation.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Overall there was a great comedy scene in Tucson. Good shows and friendly,\n              welcoming people.
