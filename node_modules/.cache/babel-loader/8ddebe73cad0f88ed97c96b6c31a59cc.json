It was Pittsburgh all\n              over again.  We began losing acceleration on a stretch of highway where\n              everyone was blowing by at 90 mph. The van limped along to the next exit.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The closest exit was just past Las Vegas.

The first\n              resident we saw zoomed past on a 4-wheeler, shirtless, with a dog perched\n              precariously atop the gas tank. Bouncing and kicking up dust clouds, every\n              pothole nearly launched the little pooch from the ATV into the next life.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Hang on, Woofy!”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Do I know you?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              This was the type of small town where everyone knows everyone.

His house is right there” and motioned toward a building encircled\n              by weatherbeaten cars and scrap metal.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Before we could reach the porch, another townsperson yelled “Tom is out! But\n              me and my boy can fix your vehicle!” It had only been three minutes and the\n              entire population was already aware of our presence.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I seent ‘em.

Every\n              talking point circled back to death. We started “Thanks for fixing this,\n              there aren’t many towns around” and he was like “Yeah, it’s good you were\n              close. Wouldn’t want to get stuck and starve to death”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When we tried to talk about how beautiful the scenery was, he replied “Yeah,\n              but you’re lucky there weren’t any elk on the road. Out here, people get\n              killed all the time hitting elk”. We kept trying to steer the topic away\n              from death, but he was an expert at bringing it back. Whenever we zigged, he\n              zagged. It kept going round and round\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image4} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We tried to steer the conversation toward Las Vegas in a last ditch effort\n              to change the subject. We asked what people do for fun there, and he said\n              “Oh, there’s plenty things for young people to do. A lot of college students\n              party and get killed driving home drunk. The roads really curve and they\n              veer off”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Realizing we’d never turn the topic, we settled the check as soon as we\n              could and left.

Unfortunately, the unexpected pit-stop ate a good\n              chunk of the day and left us essentially no time to reach Denver. We ended\n              up stopping in Pueblo for the night and got to a dispensary just before\n              closing time.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy working the counter was the only dude who looked more hipster than\n              Dan, which is no easy feat. With a manbun, beard, and black-rimmed glasses,\n              Dans hipsterness is inception level; he’s like a barber inside a baristo\n              inside a yoga instructor.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image7}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy was extremely knowledgeable. He explained the differences between\n              indica, sativa, and all the other shit we’re clueless about.  We decided to\n              buy edible gummies, chocolates, and drinks because we can’t get those things\n              in PA (legally). From there, we went to Planet Fitness.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Edibles take longer to kick in, so Dan ate a few gummies before working out.\n              I was on the phone and couldn’t join until later. By the time I entered the\n              gym, I expected to see Dan whacked out of his gourd and trying to curl the\n              leg press. To my surprise, he looked absolutely fine. He was perfectly lucid\n              and said he didn’t feel anything. He then went to shower, and I began my\n              workout.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I headed back to the van about an hour later to find Dan melted into the\n              couch and marveling at the vans roof. Hearing the door slide open, he turned\n              his head at a glacial pace to meet my gaze.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Who’d you come from?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I’d never seen anyone that high. His eyes were so red and puffy I thought he\n              had been maced. His speech was slow and garbled. With swollen eyes and\n              mumbling speech combined, he looked and sounded like Rocky.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Why do our noses run but our feet smell?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I joined Dan in eating a few gummies. I was worried that I wouldn’t get\n              high, as I had tried edibles before to no result. The guy at the shop even\n              told us that 10% of the population can’t get high from eating pot, but\n              luckily I didn’t fall into that group. Within an hour of ingestion I had\n              begun to touch eternity. An hour after that, I was already passed out.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Denver, finally</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We arrived in Denver the following morning. There’s something energizing\n              about living in a city surrounded by mountains. It just makes you feel good.\n              The scenery in Denver is beautiful and the hiking is unreal. The weather is\n              also supposed to be great. All the locals boast Denver has 300 days of\n              sunshine. Our luck with the weather was … not great, to put it mildly, but\n              we’ll get to that.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">The show</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was pretty unremarkable -- just a standard ol’ bar mic. We got busy\n              in Albuquerque and didn’t bother reaching out to any Denver hosts beforehand\n              to ask about showcases.  We tried out new material, though, so it was all\n              good. A fellow comic told us about a second mic that night, but it was a\n              school night and a bit past our bedtimes.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image2, image8]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We planned to leave the following day, but a blizzard rolled into this ‘city\n              that never rains’. They called it a ‘bomb cyclone’. We understand\n              sensationalizing in order to attract viewers, but bomb cyclone is a bit\n              much. It’s gonna scare the shit out of old people. “We’ve got a bomb\n              cyclone, followed by a rain grenade and wind rape.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Gerald, quick!

With time to\n              kill a bucket of leftover edibles, we settled in for a weird night.
