Going back to\n              the karaoke analogy - if someone says you’re not the best singer, it slides\n              right off. No big deal. That was just some drunken thing you did. But if\n              someone says <i>you’re not funny</i>, it’s like an indictment against your\n              very being.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image1, image3]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"Show #2\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The next show was at a comic book shop.

Our warning proved to be a good primer - there\n              was at least one guy who was awful.

Of all the characters you meet in the comedy\n              world, this “time waster” is a front runner in the “most annoying” category.\n              For a full description, see below.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <b>The time waster:</b> Impervious to social cues.
