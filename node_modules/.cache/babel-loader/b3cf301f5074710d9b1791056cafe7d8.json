It’s embarrassing that these moronic references were the only ones we\n              could recall, but Dan and I are simple folk.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Come again?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Communication was ok, it just took a bit of time to get the hang of\n              listening.

We’ve noticed that comics in small towns and cities are usually not\n              locals in the strict “I was born and raised here” variety, but are\n              transplants from neighboring or sometimes distant cities.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Comics relocate for various reasons but a common cause is outgrowing a\n              comedy scene. Cities are like dudes in that some are growers, others\n              show-ers.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={300}\n              captionText={\"“I’ll get bigger one day, you’ll see.

Show-er cities have marquee clubs\n              featuring national headliners, but fewer opportunities to get stage time at\n              lower levels.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              You may be wondering “Then why the hell are you guys constantly changing\n              cities?” Put simply, we think mobility accelerates development quicker than\n              remaining stationary. It provides more options. If we were stuck in one city\n              that didn’t have many mics, we wouldn’t get much practice. But because we\n              stay mobile, we can practice any time, anywhere.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It’s a bit like poker; if you’re stuck at one casino, you can only play one\n              hand at a time - whereas if you’re online you can play more hands whenever\n              and wherever you want. We figure the more rooms we do, the more comedians we\n              network with, and the more hours we accumulate on stage, the better off\n              we’ll be.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image9}\n              imageWidth={350}\n              captionText={\"“I’m all in”\"}\n            />\n\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Hometown heroes?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Confession: Dan and I are not full-fledged Philadelphians. At least in the\n              eyes of ‘real Philadelphians’. You may have heard Philly has a reputation\n              for being … ‘passionate’ about certain topics, and Philly citizenship is\n              certainly one of them.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If you were not born and raised within a certain zone, you will never be\n              considered ‘from’ Philadelphia. You may not think Philly people are bright\n              in the conventional sense - but they can recall postal codes and the exact\n              borders of the city limits like rain man.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“18901? Nice try, Bucks County”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I was born in Philadelphia but grew up in the suburbs before moving back\n              later. Dan also grew up in the burbs, so the chances of us ever being\n              considered full Philly is nil. Naturalization is not an option.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Some countries grant citizenship through investment, marriage, or lineage.\n              Not Philly. They have some of the most stringent citizenship requirements in\n              the world and are super strict about what constitutes a ‘real’\n              Philadelphian. So far as we’ve gathered, the following stipulations must be\n              adhered to for one to attain that vaunted title.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If you meet the requirements, congratulations are in order. You’ve made it\n              into the elite class.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“EEEyyy I DID it!”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The host did a great job setting the energy right in the room before we\n              began. We were in an upstairs bar that had a stage tucked in the corner.\n              Surrounding the stage were chairs, couches, and one single fold-out table.\n              It made for good crowdwork - we made jokes about how the table looked like\n              the worst Americal Idol/The Voice judges table in existence.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image3, image8]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Most of the performers did traditional standup, but a 60-something year old\n              guy came up and changed it up with song parodies and audience participation\n              -- it was refreshing. At one point he brought a lady up to the stool and\n              ‘serenaded’ her with an extremely vulgar Beetles cover.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              He then brought out tennis balls and asked the audience to call out states\n              as he juggled. His object was to name the capitals while juggling to\n              demonstrate his mental fortitude -- except whenever someone shouted a state,\n              he’d botch it. It was great. It went something like\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <b>Juggling man:</b> (never taking his eye away from the balls) I never lose\n              focus, I’m too good!
