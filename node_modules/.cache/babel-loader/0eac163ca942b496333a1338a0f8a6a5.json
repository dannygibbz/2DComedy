It’s never a toss-up between rescuing a King James\n              Spaniel or Great Dane, it’s more like “Should we get the Bull-huahua or the\n              Pit-doodle?”. It’s always a mutt that resulted from a canine dumpster orgy.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image13} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"“Reff”\"} />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was in bucket format (random selection). We hadn’t done a bucket\n              show in months, but the universe followed the standard operating procedure\n              without missing a beat - one of us performed in the first five, the other in\n              the last five.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image1, image6]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              A surprising number of non-comics randomly filtered in for brief stretches\n              throughout the show. They’d watch a few sets and then head out because one\n              in four comedians would walk the room. They’d have a bad set or engage in\n              uncomfortable crowd work and the audience members would leave. It was the\n              first time we’d ever seen a room get walked more than once.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image5} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There were a lot of comics at the mic, too. You can always spot the veterans\n              vs newbies by where they sit. First timers cluster near the stage whereas\n              veterans tuck themselves in the wayyyy back of the room.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Until next time</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After the show we hung out and connected with some of the comics. The host,\n              also named Dan, mentioned he had a few ‘Dan’ comedian friends out of\n              Davenport and the next time we come through he’ll put on a Dan-A-Palooza for\n              us all.
