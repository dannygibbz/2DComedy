When we\n              finally arrived at the venue, we were convinced we had the wrong place -\n              probably due to a miscalculation of the sun's sextant altitude and\n              curvature.'\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={280}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  “I used a Bond Chronometer <i>before</i> it was cool”\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The place was constructed in the most slapdash assemblage of components;\n              basically the architectural equivalent of Sid’s mutant doll collection from\n              Toy Story. It was 1 part impound lot, 2 parts thrift shop, 1 part speakeasy\n              and 3 parts mental asylum. As we got in, we discovered the show was a\n              music/poetry/comedy open mic - which basically means no one was there for\n              comedy.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I built this place myself, can you believe it?!”\"}\n            />\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Realizing most, if not all in attendance were decidedly <i>not</i> there for\n              comedy, I wanted to tuck tail and run.

I reversed roles in my mind -\n              if musicians sporadically performed and broke up the flow of a comedy mic,\n              the audience would be slightly annoyed.

There will be plenty of rooms where audiences don’t\n              necessarily want to listen, but it’s our job to turn the room. Utilizing\n              crowd work, keeping the show entertaining, and not getting rattled are\n              essential skills for comedians. So we decided to hang out before the show\n              and get to know some of the other mic’ers.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Strange encounter ...</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Chatting people up before shows is one of the more enjoyable things about\n              mics - you make new connections, share stories, and typically discover you\n              have a lot in common. Most people at mics are friendly, supportive, and\n              following their passion. However, there are outliers.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We heard a crash of piano keys across the room, followed by constant\n              striking of a single high note on the piano. The ominous ‘ping ping ping’\n              had an eerie melody, like in a horror movie right before the monster is\n              revealed. Fittingly, as soon as the spooky tune wrapped up, the player - who\n              was of monstrous proportions herself - drove over to us in a rascal scooter.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“And a diet coke”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If the people of Wal-Mart formed a kingdom, this woman would immediately be\n              crowned queen. To call her The Blob would be too cliché, and to call her The\n              Slob would be too lazy, so let’s settle somewhere in the middle and call her\n              The Amoeba. With every bump of the scooter, the undefined boundaries of her\n              form extended and retracted in kaleidoscopic shape-shifts. After running\n              over my foot, instead of an apology she opened the conversation with an\n              impatient “Ay I gotta sodeh round back udda chair. Coudja grab it fer me?”\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“My secret is cardio”\"}\n            />\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              “Yeah ... sure”, I said. After picking a mountain dew bottle delicately\n              between thumb and forefinger from a greasy bag, I extended it to her\n              greedily awaiting pseudopod. Before the carbonated “csssshh” of an opening\n              bottle could sound, nearly the entire soda had been consumed. With a quarter\n              inch of backwash remaining at the bottom, she asked if i’d care for a sip.\n              Although a magnanimous gesture, I politely declined.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              To get every last drop, she upended the bottle and held it suspended above\n              her gaping maw as if she were a rockstar hitting a high note. When the\n              microscopic droplets weren’t flowing quickly enough, she began to vigorously\n              shake the bottle - covering me and everyone within a 5-foot radius in\n              Mountain Dew dew. Sufficiently bone dry, she tossed the bottle into a trash\n              can. My utility as soda-fetcher concluded, and she floated off in another\n              direction to engulf the next errand boy.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"♩For those about to snack, we salute you♩\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Thoroughly shaken after that bizarre interaction, we sat at a table with\n              some new friends and settled in to enjoy the show. Each musical performer\n              was given three songs or fifteen minutes on stage. The first performer was\n              incredible. She was a classically trained musician from Pennsylvania with a\n              soulful voice. After her a guy who looked like he’d seen some shit and had\n              stories to tell took the stage. He, too, was amazing. He had gravelly vocals\n              that held eyes and ears hostage.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">\n              Let the <i>real</i> show begin\n            </h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The host then announced the next performer, who to our astonished and\n              disbelieving eyes was The Amoeba. We couldn’t believe it; we really thought\n              she was just a crazy, local yokel there to watch. We wouldn’t have guessed\n              in a million years that she’d take the stage. However Dan and I, being\n              performers, took a step back and reminded ourselves to stop being so\n              judgemental. Looks don’t indicate talent, and books shouldn’t be judged by\n              the cover. This woman could be like Susan Boyle, for all we knew.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Nope. Her skills and looks were evenly matched. The first ‘song’ began with\n              a mirror-shattering screech which became a rumbling howl, followed by an\n              atonal interlude about ‘skeeters’ (mosquitos) and ramblings of\n              half-remembered dreams. The end was part gregorian chant, part funeral\n              dirge, and abruptly guttered out like a candle without oxygen. Below is a\n              rough recounting of the lyrics\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">*Botched high note, gutteral moan*</p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">Heeyyyyyy alll, dun here be all love,</p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">Be good to eachotherrrr and love the at time</p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">*brief pause for non-existent chorus*</p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              He sed, wut?

He sed no and i … laaaannnd offff the freee\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              This continued for the entire set. Let that sink in for a moment. She\n              <i>‘sang’</i> three full <i>‘songs’</i> acapella, and{\" \"}\n              <i>made up the words as she went.</i> We couldn’t even dream of having that\n              kind of confidence on stage. During the second song, she even asked the\n              audience if they had any requests. Someone shouted “Stayin Alive!” to which\n              she replied “Sang Somethin? never heard of it”. Several other extremely\n              well-known songs were shouted out, but she hadn’t heard a single one of\n              them. I have zero doubt if someone shouted “sing Happy Birthday!” she’d act\n              like someone requested a song in Cantonese. But if someone shouted “sing\n              Cousin Zeke’s Pet Fly!” she’d be on it in an instant.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              By this point we were the definition of a captive audience. All in\n              attendance thought (correctly) that this lady was crazy, so no one wanted to\n              rock the boat. Desperate attempts to inject positive energy into the room,\n              like clapping along, died swiftly. It’s impossible to keep a beat when a\n              song has zero instrumental accompaniment or lyrical cadence. By the time the\n              collective clap had begun, it was already out of tune. It fizzled out within\n              8 seconds and the energy returned to stunned silence.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={clapping}\n              imageWidth={500}\n              captionText={\"'I am really feeling this beat'\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              She launched into the last song, which had a ‘pop-meets-colonoscopy’ sound,\n              and it seemed to go on forever. It’s worth mentioning again that all these\n              songs <i>didn’t fucking exist</i>, so no one in the audience knew when\n              they’d end. Thankfully, she cued us in by swaying her hands and bowing like\n              a conductor concluding a symphony. The bow was accompanied by a head nod and\n              utterance of a smug “ayuh” to indicate the applause was well-deserved.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Sifting through the wreckage</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Sometimes you see people bomb. Sometimes they bomb so badly, they walk the\n              room (people get up and leave). But rarest of all, the bomb is so horrific\n              that people lose the will to live. The Amoeba’s performance easily scored a\n              gold medal in the last category.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={marshmellow}\n              imageWidth={600}\n              captionText={\"*Real security footage from the mic\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              With the energy of the room unequivocally obliterated, the bewildered host\n              came back to announce the next performer. “Coming to the stage, we have Dann\n              Gibbonnssss”. That’s right. I had to follow that. It took all the courage I\n              had just to get out of my seat.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I got on stage and surveyed the room - almost everyone had evacuated to the\n              outdoor portion of the venue. With five or six remaining people in the room,\n              I started telling jokes and trying to connect. Dan C followed. It was\n              extremely challenging for us to revive the audience, and although we didn’t\n              set the room on fire in our performances, we definitely began to turn the\n              tide in the room.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Looking back now, we’re both happy that the show went the route it did. Sure\n              it was tough, but it was an incredible lesson in staying calm under\n              pressure.
