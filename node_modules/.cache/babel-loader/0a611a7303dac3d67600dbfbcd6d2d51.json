The\n              upstairs was beautiful but in true open mic/fight club fashion, we were\n              guided underground to the semi-finished basement to do our dirty deeds under\n              dimly lit string bulbs.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We could immediately tell the scene was tight based on how welcoming\n              everyone was. There were a few new faces in the room and when regulars\n              spotted them, they went over and introduced themselves. It was nice they\n              took the time to make everyone feel welcome - especially first timers, as\n              the first mic is incredibly stressful.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image4, image12]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show went great. After connecting with a few more comics we began\n              preparing our drive to <Link to=\"/Cincinnati\">Cincinnati</Link> (Cincy for\n              &nbsp;\n              <i>cool</i> people). We had met several Cincinnati comics through our\n              travels who had plenty of positive things to say about the culture. We were\n              pumped to experience it firsthand and actually spend a few nights out of the\n              van -- Dan had a cousin we could crash with.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
