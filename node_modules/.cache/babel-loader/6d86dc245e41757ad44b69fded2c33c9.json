We considered several\n              cities for our next stop like Charlotte, Columbia, and Charleston - but we\n              landed on Savannah. We’d like to say we chose Savannah for the strength of\n              its comedy scene, a club audition, or some worthwhile reason, but it’d be a\n              lie. We went there because we wanted to evade an upcoming blizzard.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Initially when choosing cities to perform in, we asked{\" \"}\n              <i>“Are there good places to perform?”</i>. Now our only question is{\" \"}\n              <i>“Is it summer there?”</i>. On our first test-run with the van we went\n              South at the end of summer and North in the beginning of winter - like\n              idiots. We baked from August to September and froze from November to\n              December. It was basically navy seal training for vanners.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Wifi signal acquired. Move, move, move!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It’s embarrassing to admit that warm weather is our only guiding compass,\n              but it’s the truth. We started with the best of intentions. Dan, being a\n              math guy, analyzed cities by largest population. He measured distance with\n              np-hard combinatorial optimization. He wrote a program for route mapping and\n              downloaded a Canadian executable. Then the temperature plummeted to 30\n              degrees and we immediately scrapped the plan without looking back.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image2}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“I hear Florida is nice this time of year”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Change of Plans</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The new route was wherever warmth was. We’re essentially moths drawn to\n              flame. The reasoning is sound, though - why program in the cold when you can\n              do it on a beach?\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image7}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Check out the 80085 on her”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The new plan was simple: go South for winter and North for summer.\n              From&nbsp;\n              <Link to=\"ChapelHill\">Chapel Hill</Link> we burned rubber for six straight\n              hours to Savannah. We slept at a Walmart for about 4 hours, then were awoken\n              by the reverse beep of every construction vehicle in the state of Georgia.\n              The beeping <i>did not stop</i>. Apparently we parked next to the world's\n              only all-reverse construction site.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“You’ve already got three forward driving violations.

A lot of people think comedy only exists in big cities like New\n              York and LA but believe it or not people in small towns laugh too.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“No we don’t, college boy”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              One of the main reasons for hitting the road was to learn what makes people\n              laugh in different parts of the country. A joke that could crush a liberal\n              Northeast audience could be met with hostility in other states. Our goal is\n              to play as many rooms as possible and be exposed to all varieties of humor.\n              We want to be able to walk into any room and kill.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageHeight={400}\n              captionText={\"“I called the constipation hotline - they asked me to hold!”\"}\n            />\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image3} imageHeight={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show in Savannah was in a microbrewery, and those are fun spots for\n              shows. The atmosphere is relaxed, the space is intimate, and everyone is\n              there to let out steam and have a good time. The crowds are usually loose\n              and provide great crowd work material - even if unintentionally. For\n              example, there was some dude at this show in the back corner that\n              periodically hacked up his entire respiratory system every ten minutes, and\n              that made for good riffing. That might seem mean, but if you come out and\n              cough SARS all over everyone, you’re fair game.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              About 15 comics performed that night and it was a great show.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image9, image8]}\n              imageHeight={380}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The local comedians were a real friendly bunch and they told us about\n              upcoming mics later in the week.
