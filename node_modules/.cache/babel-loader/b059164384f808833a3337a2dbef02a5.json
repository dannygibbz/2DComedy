Foodwise, it’s the HQ for Yum brands (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza\n              Hut), so you can really bust a gut.

Some think it’s pronounced Lewis-ville, but that’s not it.\n              The next guess is pronouncing it like Louie-ville, but that’s still not\n              drunk enough.

We don’t know.  He\n              bopped the babydolls head with a chess board and then acted like there was a\n              bomb inside that was gonna explode. He even had a countdown and asked &nbsp;\n              <i>“Aren’t y’all scared?”</i> as the countdown from 10 reached 3.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[DanG, image8]}\n              imageHeight={210}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Dan and I tried out some new stuff and had a blast. The room was only about\n              25-30 people so it was intimate enough to have some fun crowd work. After\n              the show we connected with some comics. We’re always grateful when local\n              comics take us in and recommend/offer new spots in their city. We definitely\n              look forward to coming back through Louisville.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The next stop was <Link to=\"/Huntington\">Huntington, West Virginia.</Link>\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
