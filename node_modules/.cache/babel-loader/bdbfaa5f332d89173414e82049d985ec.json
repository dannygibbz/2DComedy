Without a moment's hesitation the friend said\n              “If a shark bit me, I’d just punch it in the nose”. Why does every idiot\n              think that’ll work? It’s a 400 million year old apex predator. Do they\n              really think sharks have a Death Star-like weakness where they just explode\n              if you hit the right point?\n            </p>\n            <div\n              style={{\n                display: \"flex\",\n                alignItems: \"center\",\n                marginBottom: \"25px\",\n                flexWrap: \"wrap\",\n              }}\n            >\n              <div>\n                <img src={image6} height={160} width={195} alt=\"Shark\" />\n              </div>\n              <div style={{ fontSize: \"48px\", marginRight: \"10px\", marginLeft: \"10px\" }}>\n                {\" \"}\n                +{\" \"}\n              </div>\n              <img src={image4} height={160} width={195} alt=\"Punch\" />\n              <div style={{ fontSize: \"48px\", marginRight: \"10px\", marginLeft: \"10px\" }}>\n                {\" \"}\n                ={\" \"}\n              </div>\n              <img src={image5} height={160} width={195} alt=\"Explosion\" />\n            </div>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy answered that question with the utmost sincerity. He truly believed\n              if a shark clamped down on his leg, he’d give it a knuckle sandwich and walk\n              off. It was hard not to laugh out loud. Like - that’s what you’re gonna do?\n              You’re gonna give this ten thousand pound killing machine a bop on the\n              sniffer? A little slap on the snoot? Why not give it a Wet Willy? They hate\n              that.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image9}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“If you don’t knock it off, a wicked noogie is headed your way!”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It’s hard enough to punch a human on land, but you’re confident you can KO a\n              shark under water? A shark's nose is mere centimeters above its mouth. And\n              in case you forgot, the nose comes to a point. It’s just a slippery slope\n              into its mouth. You’re basically just feeding your arm to the shark.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              These guys kept running through hypothetical scenarios - each more\n              implausible than the next -  in which they crushed every imaginary\n              challenge. I love listening to that kinda stuff. It’s the perfect way to\n              identify how full of shit someone is. The quicker the answer, the fuller of\n              shit.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I wanted to follow these guys around the aquarium to eavesdrop for more\n              material, but we had to get to to our first mic of the week.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Hurry up and wait</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We’ve discussed this in prior posts but when there’s a lottery system for\n              performing at mics, one of us always gets picked in the first five, the\n              other in the last five. If you’re one of the first five performers, it’s\n              great. The audience is fresh and you get useful feedback on jokes.

Anonymity makes\n              everyone more comfortable in their actions. If you don’t believe that, then\n              you’ve never read comments on the internet.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image7}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“I’m a navy seal and I’ll kick your ass you stupid fucking pussy bitch”\"\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If the connection between anonymity and laughter is still unclear, imagine\n              the following. It’s Friday night and you decide catch a comedy show. The\n              club is packed and dimly lit. When edgy jokes start flying, you feel\n              comfortable laughing because you’re a grain of salt in a sea of strangers.\n              But now think about the same comic doing the same set for a corporate gig at\n              your well-lit workplace. You’re sitting at a table with your boss and\n              coworkers. When the comic hits that abortion joke, do you think you’d howl\n              with laughter?\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image11}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  “Oh, I guess prematurely terminating my <i>employment</i> is ok”\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I went fourth that night, Dan C went second to last. By that time it was\n              only me, the host, and the final comic in the audience. Tough to get good\n              feedback with such a small crowd but that’s just how it shakes out\n              sometimes.

It started out great - there were a\n              lot of comics and non-comics in attendance. However, it pretty quickly went\n              off the rails. A table of obnoxious people in the middle of the room got\n              totally hammered and either heckled or too-loudly-laughed their way through\n              a bunch of sets. The host set them straight several times but the damage was\n              done.

Dan went first and\n              managed to wring laughs out of the crowd. It was impressive - the energy in\n              the room was totally dead and few remained, but he made it work.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I was excited to riff and playfully shit on the table who had been drinking\n              and heckling. I have a couple of drinking jokes that I knew would hit. But\n              when I was walking to the stage, that whole table was leaving. Without those\n              people to connect with, I bombed. I ate shit for five silent minutes.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Kicked off the horse</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We went to IHOP after the show to drown our sorrows in syrup.
