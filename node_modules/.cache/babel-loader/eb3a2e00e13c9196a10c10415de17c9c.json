We had very little\n              time to explore - even on stage it felt like we had to sprint just to make\n              it to the next city.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image2}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"“My girlfriend wanted to try anal and BOY is my ass sore!

Of course the usual suspects\n              popped up (New York, LA, Chicago, etc) but there was a lot of buzz around\n              Madison. It’s Chris Farley’s hometown and a lot of talented comedians come\n              out of there.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                \"You can't even begin to imagine how many people have made this joke at us\"\n              }\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Living up to the rep</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When we arrived in Madison we weren’t let down. The entire city was buzzing\n              as it was college move-in day. People were out and about and there was live\n              music in the streets. We first knew Madison was going to be cool when a\n              drunk guy in Portland wouldn’t stop talking about it. Then we got there and\n              realized he was right.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The Midwest as a whole is a hotbed of comedy. When you live in a place\n              that’s inhospitably cold you either learn to make jokes about it or drink\n              yourself to death. Just kidding about that last sentence - being a comedian\n              and boozing hardcore are by no means mutually exclusive.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"Some would say it’s the norm\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              And just because you’re from somewhere cold doesn’t mean you’re funny\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"We’re looking at YOU, Russia\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              People from Wisconsin really are a fun, awesome bunch. We’ll put it this\n              way: anyone who’s willing to get drunk and hang out in the blistering cold\n              with a cheese hat is crazy in the best way.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“8 degrees?

It was technically an open mic, but was\n              much better than most booked shows. In both cities, anywhere from 30-60\n              comedians sign up to get on these mics and only 10-20 get on. Real audiences\n              come to these shows and turnouts are usually huge.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              In both instances we reached out to the hosts beforehand to get spots on the\n              show, otherwise we never would’ve got on. These shows usually run on a\n              lottery system and it could’ve taken weeks to finally be picked. Luckily the\n              hosts at both were really accomodating to traveling comics.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Comedy on State was a great venue. The showroom had awesome acoustics and\n              there was a live feed of every performer piped into the bar, lobby, and even\n              the bathrooms.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Weirdness witnessed</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              At this point we’ve seen all manner of bizarre acts. Here are but a few\n              things we’ve witnessed at open mics.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              That night we added a new one to the list. A guy got up and sang the entire\n              song ‘Hallelujah’ but at the chorus instead of saying ‘Hallelujah’, he sang\n              ’Tony Shal-houb’. It fucking crushed so hard. Between verses, everyone knew\n              what was coming and it still killed.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy who followed him said “What the fuck was that? How can I follow that\n              freak?” but he actually did really well. I was talking to him after the show\n              when the host approached him and said “Hey, man, I wasn’t trying to sail you\n              down the river on that one. I’ve seen that bit obliterate crowds and I knew\n              you’d be able to follow it”. It was a sign of respect.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Thanks. Thanks so much”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was broken into two halves - each half featuring 10 comics and\n              lasting about an hour. I kicked off the second half and Dan went on two\n              comics later. The crowd was awesome and we both did really well.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[DCrescimanno, DanGibbs]}\n              imageWidth={600}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After the show, the comedians all went to a bar next door to hang out. It\n              seemed like the Madison comedy scene had a really supportive, tight-knit\n              culture. The city as a whole seemed like a great city to grow and get good.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If we didn’t have to drive straight to <Link to=\"/Detroit\">Detroit</Link> we\n              definitely would have hung around and got to know the comics more. We’re\n              looking forward to coming back!\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
