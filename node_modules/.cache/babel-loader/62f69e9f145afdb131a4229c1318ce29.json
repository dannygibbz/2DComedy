When we asked about hiking and biking, he said\n              “the homeless people steal bikes and stockpile them. Maybe 300 or more. I\n              don’t even know what they do with them”.

They were\n              super friendly and knowledgeable about Alaskan wildlife. They pointed out\n              moose tracks, showed us where bears roam, and named just about every bird in\n              the state. And then they began to descend into weirdness.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The husband would be telling a story and all of a sudden stop, jerk\n              binoculars to his face, and shout “Babe, look! It’s a (insert bird name)!!”.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image12}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Wow! Two Blueball Warblers!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy would also hock huge loogies in the middle of stories. One was so\n              powerful he gripped the railing, leaned back, and lunged forward to spit it\n              out (with quite an impressive arc). He then dusted himself off and strolled\n              back over, casually farting with each step. We’re curious at what age we’ll\n              begin doing old guy shit like that.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              At a certain point, behaviors better define mens age than numbers. Saying\n              “He’s in his 70’s” is vague. But saying “He keeps a bowl of butterscotch\n              hard candies on the coffee table” is as precise as carbon dating. So, next\n              time someone asks about age, answer with behaviors instead of numbers.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image17}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  <b>Age</b>: Socks and sandals years old\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image10}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  <b>Age</b>: Spouting racial slurs willy nilly years old\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">And last, but not least.</p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image18}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\n                <div>\n                  <b>Age</b>: Permanently naked in the locker room years old\n                </div>\n              }\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Animal Lovers</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              People had immense affection for animals and the outdoors in Alaska … but\n              they seemed to love <i>dead</i> animals. We mentioned going whale watching\n              and someone excitedly yelled “Oh! I heard one washed up on the beach in\n              Juneau!”. They yearned with all their being to journey 850 miles for a\n              rotten carcass.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“It’s …*sniffs*    it’s beautiful *sobs*”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              You may think we’re joking about joy in seeing animal remains, but we’re\n              not. The couple we met earlier wouldn’t stop talking about “calf kills”\n              (bears killing young moose). Apparently, these are recorded events and if\n              you witness one, it’s like winning the lottery. While telling the stories,\n              they could scarcely contain their excitement. Their enthusiasm was bubbling\n              over so vigorously we thought they were becoming aroused.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              They even escorted us to the end of the boardwalk where the remains of a\n              moose lay. With the pride of a child showing off a new bike, the guy pointed\n              and beamed “See there? That was a moose. It got killed earlier in winter”.\n              All that remained were clumps of hair with dirty bones strewn about.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The guy continued “We come often to check it out. Even in the winter when it\n              was just 10 degrees we’d see it change. We even saw a hawk fly away with\n              part of a limb once!”. For us, ‘watching the gradual decomposition of a\n              moose’ is last on our ideas for romantic dates,  but for this couple it was\n              the height of marital bliss.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image14}\n              imageWidth={450}\n              captionText={\"“I’m so HORNY. Take me now, babe”\"}\n            />\n\n            <h2 className=\"header\">The comedy scene</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The Anchorage scene was small and tight. Then again, the comedy world in\n              general is smaller than you'd think. We had just done shows in Portland and\n              Seattle, and some of those comics already knew the Anchorage comics. It’s\n              always awesome to have a warm welcome because everyone's a friend of a\n              friend.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              In terms of shows, they have weekly and monthly mics/showcases in Anchorage\n              and the audiences vary by season. During winter, the locals come to all of\n              the shows. During summer, the locals stay home to avoid all the tourists and\n              the tourists go to all the shows.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The show was on Friday night at the Hard Rock Cafe. The audience was fun - a\n              lot of tourists pop in and fill the place up during summer. There were 3\n              Matt’s, 2 Dan’s, and one Kass on the show. We now book shows exclusively\n              based on the repetition of performers names.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image4, image16]}\n              imageHeight={200}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We and the Matt’s did 15 minutes apiece, the host (Matt) and Kass knocked\n              out 5 apiece. We really enjoyed sharing the stage and spending time with the\n              Alaskan comics before/after the show. As always we were thankful for the\n              hospitality and being treated so well by our local hosts.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Until next time</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Coming into Alaska, the plane was packed. Going out of Alaska, the plane was\n              empty. The math simply didn’t add up. New arrivals were either starting\n              fresh lives off the grid or getting killed by bike hoarding murderers in the\n              woods.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Our flight departed at 12:40 a.m. Although there were enough empty seats for\n              every passenger to have their own row to themselves, I was lucky enough to\n              sit next to a guy who smelled like a medley of stale budweiser and ashtray.\n              I excused myself to ‘use the restroom’ before takeoff and never returned to\n              that seat.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We got back to Seattle around 5 a.m. and picked up the van from long-term\n              parking. After catching a few winks, we fueled up at IHOP and hit the road\n              for <Link to=\"/Missoula\">Missoula, Montana</Link> - where we did our first\n              two-man show.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
