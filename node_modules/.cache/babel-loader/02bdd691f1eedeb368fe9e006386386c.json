The extreme temperatures made it nearly impossible to sleep in\n              the van. It was seriously like trying to sleep in a sauna. We’d hydrate all\n              day just so we could survive the night.

Instead of a table, we\n              balanced our trays precariously wherever we could find space. Instead of\n              sturdy, glass trays, we bought flimsy tin-foil trays that bent constantly.\n              Whenever we shifted throughout the night, water spilled everywhere. It\n              looked like we booby trapped ourselves. By morning the rug was soaked and\n              already beginning to smell moldy.

Dan and\n              I were numbers 31 and 38. Even if everyone before did 3 minutes, we wouldn’t\n              go up for hours.

It’s not worth waiting four hours to do three\n              minutes. It’s just not. Our time is better spent writing, shooting video\n              content, and reaching out to bookers.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There’s no benefit in performing at a mic (or anywhere, really) 3+ hours\n              into a show. The audience is shot. You’ll probably end up performing to two\n              people - your friend, and the tired host.

Any\n              longer and audiences become restless. Viewers of Netflix comedy specials\n              only tune in for 30 minutes on average. That says something. That means even\n              when watching the very best comedians, comedy fans are still like “Meh,\n              let’s move on” after a half hour. And that's from the comfort of their own\n              homes. How enthused do you think they’ll be to see amateur material 3{\" \"}\n              <b>hours</b> into a show from the relative discomfort of a club?\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Improv</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There was an improv mic the following day. We had seen pros doing improv\n              standup in a series called ‘Standup Without a Net’ and wanted to give it a\n              try ourselves. As you probably guessed, it’s much harder than traditional\n              standup. We wanted to challenge ourselves.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              For anyone unsure of what an improv mic entails, it works like this: a bowl\n              is filled with random words or topics written on slips of paper. Every\n              comedian picks three topics during their 5-minute set. Whatever the topic\n              is, the comedian has to improvise jokes on the spot. No written or old\n              material can be used.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Report Cards</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              <b>Dan G:</b> I did NOT do well. If my set were a pop quiz in school, I’d’ve\n              got a 33%. I could only make 1 of the 3 topics funny. My first topic was{\" \"}\n              <i>cottage cheese</i>. I talked about how stupid it is that people use\n              cottage cheese to describe cellulite, like \"look at those cottage cheese\n              legs\". I made some jokes questioning how and why cheese ever became the\n              object to compare people to and questioned what other cheeses might make\n              good descriptions. It got a few chuckles - which is a nice way of saying it\n              failed.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The second topic I got was <i>dead celebrities</i>. I could’ve gone with\n              some cheap Michael Jackson jokes but decided instead to go for the ‘higher\n              ground’, and talk about how this year has been relatively good in terms of\n              celebrity deaths as there haven't been many. I died upon that ‘high’ hill. I\n              got no laughs.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The third topic was <i>homeless people</i>. This one finally worked. I made\n              jokes about donating bluetooth headsets to the homeless because it would\n              make them look less insane when talking to themselves.

I’d give myself a firm 15%, and then\n              call my parents and tell them that little Danny probably isn’t going to\n              college. I started strong with some decent crowdwork that worked off the\n              weirdness of the previous comics (one stated that he wanted to fuck a dog,\n              and the audience cheered). But then I started drawing topics.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              First topic: <i>Awkward Sexual Encounter</i>\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I relayed a story about trying to get laid in my girlfriend’s car in a park\n              after hours. And when I took my pants off, a police light shot through the\n              window and illuminated my ass in full glory. Every cop has a dashcam, and\n              I’m positive that in some police vault there is a video of my 17-year old\n              white ass. I did not get laid that night.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Second topic: <i>Drugs</i>\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I rarely do drugs. But I riffed on using Adderal once when I worked in\n              finance, and then instead of getting any work done, and decided to run the\n              Brooklyn Bridge and talk to strangers for 4 hours.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Third Topic: <i>Deer Crossing</i>\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              I talked about driving through Wyoming and hitting the world’s largest bird,\n              leaving a huge dent in the van. The van, as our 6 readers will know, already\n              looks terrifying, it being an unmarked white van and all. But the red blood\n              smeared across the front adds a new layer to our friendly van vibe.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">None of these were particularly funny.</p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image2} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Grounded</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Our report cards were lousy. We could FORGET about a congratulatory trip to\n              Dairy Queen.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image8} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Although we ate it, the improv mic was a good experience. It was like doing\n              a new workout that leaves you sore in places you didn’t know could get sore.\n              It was a painful yet important reminder that an improv muscle lurks\n              somewhere, and it demands to be strengthened.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              After having our fun in Kansas City, we headed East for{\" \"}\n              <Link to=\"/StLouis\">St. Louis</Link>.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
