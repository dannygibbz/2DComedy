We still had Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming to\n              cover.

It’d be unsettling to discover we had the same insatiable\n              bloodlust in real life as we did in the game. Hunting in the Oregon Trail\n              really brought the worst out of everyone -- it turned regular people into\n              homicidal maniacs. You wouldn’t hunt to satisfaction; you’d hunt to\n              extinction.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image8}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Who’s hungry?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The wagon could hold maybe 200 pounds of rations but your hunt would yield\n              2,339 pounds.

After the ammo was out\n              you’d dry fire at any animal with the gall to cross your screen.

They even coined the term ‘killing’ as it pertains to comedy (getting\n              huge laughs). You see, in those days laughter wasn’t the only thing\n              contagious. Following punchlines, wet chortles rattled out of\n              consumption-ridden lungs and spread countless germs through the air.

We had previously performed in\n              Kansas City Missouri, but not in Kansas itself. We checked around for mics\n              in the big cities (Wichita, KC, Olathe) but didn’t come up with much.\n              Luckily we found a club called ‘Clint’s Comedy Stop’ In Overland Park.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image2} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It was a nice little club and the owner, Clint, was a supremely nice guy.

Most of the comedians worked out of\n              Kansas City but there were a few out of different reaches in Kansas. Dan and\n              I were the only ‘true’ out of towners. The crowd seemed very midwestern\n              (e.g. extremely polite) because they’d clam up whenever we used profanity.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Clint was nice enough to give us a few extra minutes and we used the time to\n              test new jokes.
