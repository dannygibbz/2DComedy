You\n              come-to in a heavy lidded, semi-conscious fog where every flick of the eye\n              drags with it a blurry tracer of the room. You’re not quite sure where you\n              are or how you got there. Flashes of the previous night eventually filter in\n              and form a rough timeline of events. Only after recognizing the crystalline\n              glitter of a frosted windshield did I slowly begin to piece things together.\n              We had left <Link to={\"/PortlandME\"}>Portland</Link> and ended up in\n              Concord, New Hampshire.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Shifting uncomfortably in cocoon-like sleeping bags, our wool-capped heads\n              and bearded faces were the only exposed bits. If anyone looked in the\n              window, they’d think they were witnessing the pupa stage of hipster\n              metamorphosis. You’d think having a beard would help with the cold, but it\n              makes it worse. Puffs of steamy breath hang in viscous clouds above your\n              face, leaving your mouth a soggy mess. It’s like receiving a nighttime visit\n              from a sexually deviant ghost.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image4}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"”Was it as good for you as it was for me?”\"}\n            />\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Mistakes were made</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Owing to our flat-out lack of craftsmanship, sleeping outside probably\n              would’ve been warmer than sleeping in the van. We spent days researching the\n              best methods for insulation. We spent weeks studying the pros and cons of\n              foam-board and fibrous systems. We spent months measuring, cutting out, and\n              affixing insulation to the floor, ceiling, and individual wall panels.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              As we locked the last panel into place, it was clear the insulation was an\n              unmitigated failure. If we had done nothing, it would have been better. We\n              somehow managed to create reverse insulation where outside temperature is\n              sucked in and intensified. When it’s hot, the van is blistering. When it’s\n              cold, the van is arctic.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image5}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“The conversion was a piece of cake”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Even homeless people sleep better than we do. When temperatures plunge\n              beneath freezing, they stay in churches and shelters that provide warm beds.\n              Not us. We stay in a frosty cardboard box that cost a lot, so homeless\n              people manage money better than we do, too.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When people die outside, it’s sad. If a homeless person dies of hypothermia,\n              people lament “Man, he got a sad lot in life. It’s terrible he didn’t get\n              the help he needed”. But if you freeze to death in your own car, people\n              think “Man, this guy was a friggin idiot”, and your family has to pretend\n              you weren’t a total moron at the funeral.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If we freeze to death, we only hope that our bodies and those of our frozen\n              homeless brethren will be put to good use; perhaps like Mt. Everest where\n              frozen corpses serve as guideposts. “Coffee shop? Sure, walk North past\n              Toothless Thomas, then bang a left at the Dipshit Dans and Starbucks will be\n              on the corner between Captain Crumbjacket and Señor Catscratch”.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Time to warm up</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It isn’t all bad; cold weather helps immensely in achieving weight loss\n              goals. You can lose up to 20 pounds a week once your frozen limbs are hacked\n              off. Why spend money on a gym membership when you can do Body by Frostbite\n              for free? Step aside, Planet Fitness, there’s a new kid in town.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It’s amazing how quickly people find silver linings for situations they’ll\n              never be in. Whenever we discuss how cold the van is, someone will\n              inevitably say “that’s not so bad, at least you can burn more calories”.\n              Yeah, because we’re so damn cold the muscles violently contract to create\n              heat. It’s not ideal or voluntary. It’s like going up to someone who lost\n              their legs and saying “walking with crutches isn’t so bad, you can build\n              your upper body”.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We usually practice sets in the van to prepare for shows, but that night it\n              was so cold we had trouble remembering our jokes. Even if we had remembered,\n              jokes tend to lose their punch when delivered with quivering breath and\n              chattering teeth.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image6}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“What’s the deal with airplanes?”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We decided to go into the venue well before the mic was to start, just for\n              the warmth. We opened the doors to a packed house and were pumped! It’s rare\n              for regular audience (non-comics) to attend, or in this case fill the room.\n              The whole reason we do mics is to practice for shows with a ‘real' audience,\n              so when the opportunity presents itself, we jump on it. Thawing out at the\n              bar, we asked around and were told the huge crowd was there for trivia\n              night.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The mic immediately followed trivia and we held out hope thinking folks\n              would stay and hang around for the show. How foolish. No sooner had the\n              winning team been announced than the crowd dispersed as if a canister of\n              tear gas exploded.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Sudden promotion</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              It was mildly depressing seeing the huge crowd vanish, but we had played\n              small rooms before and figured we’d shoot the shit with other comics before\n              the show. When we didn't spot any figures hunched over notebooks or mouthing\n              jokes, we began to get nervous. As the ever-dwindling crowd continued their\n              march out the door, panic slowly crept in. “There’s no way we’re the only\n              comics here” we murmured halfheartedly, trying to allay our fear.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              By gametime neither the host nor any comics at all showed up. In the most\n              spectacular promotion of our young careers, we had gone from mic’ers to host\n              to headliners in an instant.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image2}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Enough applause, ladies and gentlemen! You’re too kind!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The space we had to perform in was, to put delicately, bad. We were tucked\n              in the far corner of the room, sandwiched between a piano and dart board. No\n              stage, no lighting. The guy who had MC’ed trivia came over and handed us one\n              of those old-timey microphones that Elvis used and basically told us to let\n              ‘er rip. So with no context, no setup, and no explanation, it was time to\n              start telling jokes.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The patrons couldn’t have been less interested. One guy at the bar clunked\n              down his prehistoric laptop and began “making trades” despite the market\n              having been closed for five hours.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image1}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“This ‘Enron’ thing is the future”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              A couple sitting front and center (or middle and diagonal) tapped their toes\n              impatiently as we performed - apparently we were interrupting their romantic\n              game of darts. Three older gentlemen sat in the far back of the room, mere\n              specks on the horizon. Lastly, a small band of drunk regulars sat at the bar\n              facing the opposite wall.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              There were perhaps 10 people all told when Dan launched into his set. He\n              chatted with the audience to warm them up, then hit them with jokes. Even\n              though most didn’t want to hear comedy and some even talked through the set,\n              Dan didn’t allow the audience to break him. He stayed in bits and ran\n              material. It wasn’t until the end that he comically but earnestly dressed\n              the audience down - which basically means chiding the audience for being\n              rude or lame.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We saw a comic give a dressing down at a mic in NYC.  Seeing the sparsely\n              occupied room of comics, this dude went in hard - saying something like\n              “Man, fuck this. I hate this so much. I hope all of you fucking die. What\n              are we even doing here? I don’t know what happened to me. I used to be so\n              funny. Now I fuckin waste my time at these things and it sucks the life\n              outta me” For comics, it’s hilarious. When someone is utterly exasperated\n              and says real shit, it resonates because we’ve all been there. We’ve waited\n              hours upon hours for our turn to perform, only to play an empty or\n              disinterested room.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              When you’re in a room full of people with shared experience, dressing down\n              is hilarious because it’s relatable. But when you’re in an empty bar in\n              small town New Hampshire, it’s jarring. When Dan hit the room with “I hope\n              you all die in the most horrific way, hopefully a barn fire” you could feel\n              the energy shift from indifference to anger. With that, Dan took leave and\n              passed me the torch.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption\n              imageUrl={image3}\n              imageWidth={400}\n              captionText={\"“Warmed ‘em up for ya!”\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Gauging the room, I decided the best course of action was to hit them with\n              local jokes (mocking Concord’s pronunciation, talking about ‘wicked’ vs.\n              ‘really’, etc). If I had launched into material without connecting to the\n              audience, it would’ve gone over like a mid-BJ fart. The crowd was with me\n              for the Concord-specific jokes, but began to stray once the usual set began.\n              I didn’t bring the house down, but learned for next time that if something\n              is working, stick with it.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The cool thing about standup is even if you eat shit (and we did), you can\n              potentially brighten at least one person’s day. After the ‘show’, a guy in\n              his mid-50’s excitedly came up and started talking. He thanked us for coming\n              out, saying it was the best comedy night they’d had in a long time. He began\n              listing the comedy podcasts he listened to and naming the comedians he\n              loved, and it was a great chat. Even though we were bummed about our\n              performances and were ready to jump off a bridge, this guy had a great\n              night. Small moments like that turn what would otherwise be soul-crushing\n              experiences into worthwhile and reaffirming experiences.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              The next morning we returned to Philly. Within the first three hours of the\n              drive, the temperature increased 15 degrees. We were never so happy to get\n              back to temperatures in the 40’s. We decompressed for a week or two in\n              Philly before heading back on the road to{\" \"}\n              <Link to={\"/Baltimore\"}>Baltimore</Link>.\n            </p>\n            <NewsletterEmail />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
