When we pulled up to the club, the road was\n              closed for some sort street festival or block party. The sidewalks were\n              spilling over with food carts, live bands, and all manner of vendor booths.\n              It looked awesome, but we’d have to wait until after the show to check it\n              out.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Parlez-vous français?</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              One of the comedians talked about how much fun she had on a recent trip to\n              France and described how enamored she was with the language. I’m undoubtedly\n              in the minority here, but I don’t think French is sexy.

I will acknowledge, however, that it’s not\n              really a ‘cool’ language. Whenever I tell someone I speak German, it never\n              elicits a positive response. They assume I’m either a nazi or I love porn\n              where people shit all over eachother.

If you were a cool\n              kid, you took French. If you were an average kid looking for an easy grade,\n              you took Spanish. If you were a nerd looking to get a leg up on the SAT, you\n              took Latin (which doesn’t help by the way - it turns out the SAT’s are\n              entirely in English).

We were you guys.\n              Dan and I didn’t get on stage until we were 26 and 27 years old.

You’re probably thinking “But I don’t know any\n              comedians, I don’t know the comedy scene in my city, I don’t know how to\n              sign up, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know!”. We were the same. We\n              needed a metaphorical gun to the head to get on stage - meaning we signed up\n              for a show and told everyone we knew about it so that we couldn’t chicken\n              out.\n            </p>\n            <ImageAndCaption imageUrl={image5} imageWidth={400} captionText={\"\"} />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If that sounds like you, then try this. Jump on Google or Facebook and type\n              ‘standup comedy in (your city)’. Chances are you’ll find some open mics or\n              events to attend. Sign yourself up and tell all your friends and family “On\n              X date I’m performing standup at Y venue”. It’s scary, but if you don’t draw\n              a line in the sand then your standup aspirations will forever be trapped in\n              that nebulous “I’ll try it someday” stage.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Showtime</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              We did a show at The Comedy Zone.

Before the\n              show we hung around some of the comics and they were from all over. There\n              were people from NJ, NY, and various southern states. As per usual everyone\n              was really chill and friendly. They came up and introduced themselves and we\n              hit it off.\n            </p>\n            <MultiImageAndCaption\n              imageUrls={[image1, image4, image11, image6]}\n              imageHeight={280}\n              captionText={\"\"}\n            />\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Most of our new material hit, so the jokes got to survive another day.

We’ve\n              been noticing a trend where totally overconfident people (usually middle\n              aged guys, for whatever reason) get up and throw around incoherent,\n              offensive ‘material’ and that doesn’t work. To clarify: offensive, to us,\n              means ‘unfunny’. You can make jokes about any topic - nothing is off limits\n              - just make it funny.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              If you really want to do comedy, don’t be one of those “My friends say I’m\n              funny, I’m just gonna get up there and riff!” types. That’s not gonna work\n              (unless you really are a genius). You’re going to bomb, run the light, and\n              have your confidence crushed. Do yourself a favor and write material before\n              going up. Practice your set beforehand, too. It sounds obvious, but is often\n              overlooked.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"header\">Au revoir!</h2>\n            <p className=\"copytext\">\n              Before leaving town we were excited to stroll around the street\n              festival/block party we had seen prior to entering the club.
